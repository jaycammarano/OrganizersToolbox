# tool.box

An open source option for creating and managing a
political or social grassroots campaign. It starts a leader at the beginning of the creation process with a questionaire to help guide the thought process of

- What is the problem?
- Who does it affect?
- What action is the org trying to take?

These will be used to help a user all the way through writing a mission statement
and creating their first campaign.

After completing their profile users will be able to
access various tools that help them create action items,
spread their message, and generally organize a campaign
tailored to their needs.
